<h1>
    Domestic pharmaceutical flow spatial pattern
</h1>
We applied the same analysis from <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab29ae">Food flows between counties in the United States</a> on the pharmaceutical product flow network. Following this paper, we computed centrality value of a node as the between-ness centrality value of the node, and connectivity value of a node as its node degree. According to this paper, <i>a 'core' group of counties is evident which have both <b>high connectivity and centrality</b> and are critical to the structure of the flow network.</i>
